Running the command 'make all' will compile the source code
and create the executable versions of all implementations:

dppdiv-seq      - The original unoptimized, single-thread
dppdiv-seq-avx  - AVX optimized, single-thread
dppdiv-seq-sse  - SSE optimized, single-thread
dppdiv-par      - Unoptimized, multi-thread
dppdiv-par-sse  - SSE optimized, multi-thread
dppdiv-par-avx  - AVX optimized, multi-thread

One can compile only a specific implementation by running the command:

make implementation

substituting 'implementation' with the corresponding name. For example, to
compile the SSE optimized, multithreaded implementation, you may run:

make dppdiv-sse-par

To specify the number of threads in the multi-thread version, set the
OMP_NUM_THREADS variable in your shell environment. For example, in bash:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16

will set the program to run with 16 threads.
You may also pin each thread to a specific processor by setting up the
GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY variable. For more info on this variable, check:
